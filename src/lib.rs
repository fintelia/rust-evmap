//! A lock-free, eventually consistent, concurrent multi-value map.
//!
//! This map implementation allows reads and writes to execute entirely in parallel, with no
//! implicit synchronization overhead. Reads never take locks on their critical path, and neither
//! do writes assuming there is a single writer (multi-writer is possible using a `Mutex`), which
//! significantly improves performance under contention.
//!
//! The trade-off exposed by this module is one of eventual consistency: writes are not visible to
//! readers except following explicit synchronization. Specifically, readers only see the
//! operations that preceeded the last call to `WriteHandle::refresh` by a writer. This lets
//! writers decide how stale they are willing to let reads get. They can refresh the map after
//! every write to emulate a regular concurrent `HashMap`, or they can refresh only occasionally to
//! reduce the synchronization overhead at the cost of stale reads.
//!
//! For read-heavy workloads, the scheme used by this module is particularly useful. Writers can
//! afford to refresh after every write, which provides up-to-date reads, and readers remain fast
//! as they do not need to ever take locks.
//!
//! The map is multi-value, meaning that every key maps to a *collection* of values. This
//! introduces some memory cost by adding a layer of indirection through a `Vec` for each value,
//! but enables more advanced use. This choice was made as it would not be possible to emulate such
//! functionality on top of the semantics of this map (think about it -- what would the operational
//! log contain?).
//!
//! To faciliate more advanced use-cases, each of the two maps also carry some customizeable
//! meta-information. The writers may update this at will, and when a refresh happens, the current
//! meta will also be made visible to readers. This could be useful, for example, to indicate what
//! time the refresh happened.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Single-reader, single-writer
//!
//! ```
//! // new will use the default HashMap hasher, and a meta of ()
//! // note that we get separate read and write handles
//! // the read handle can be cloned to have more readers
//! let (book_reviews_r, mut book_reviews_w) = evmap::new();
//!
//! // review some books.
//! book_reviews_w.insert("Adventures of Huckleberry Finn",    "My favorite book.");
//! book_reviews_w.insert("Grimms' Fairy Tales",               "Masterpiece.");
//! book_reviews_w.insert("Pride and Prejudice",               "Very enjoyable.");
//! book_reviews_w.insert("The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes", "Eye lyked it alot.");
//!
//! // at this point, reads from book_reviews_r will not see any of the reviews!
//! assert_eq!(book_reviews_r.len(), 0);
//! // we need to refresh first to make the writes visible
//! book_reviews_w.refresh();
//! assert_eq!(book_reviews_r.len(), 4);
//! // reads will now return Some() because the map has been initialized
//! assert_eq!(book_reviews_r.get_and("Grimms' Fairy Tales", |rs| rs.len()), Some(1));
//!
//! // remember, this is a multi-value map, so we can have many reviews
//! book_reviews_w.insert("Grimms' Fairy Tales",               "Eh, the title seemed weird.");
//! book_reviews_w.insert("Pride and Prejudice",               "Too many words.");
//!
//! // but again, new writes are not yet visible
//! assert_eq!(book_reviews_r.get_and("Grimms' Fairy Tales", |rs| rs.len()), Some(1));
//!
//! // we need to refresh first
//! book_reviews_w.refresh();
//! assert_eq!(book_reviews_r.get_and("Grimms' Fairy Tales", |rs| rs.len()), Some(2));
//!
//! // oops, this review has a lot of spelling mistakes, let's delete it.
//! // empty deletes *all* reviews (though in this case, just one)
//! book_reviews_w.empty("The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes");
//! // but again, it's not visible to readers until we refresh
//! assert_eq!(book_reviews_r.get_and("The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes", |rs| rs.len()), Some(1));
//! book_reviews_w.refresh();
//! assert_eq!(book_reviews_r.get_and("The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes", |rs| rs.len()), None);
//!
//! // look up the values associated with some keys.
//! let to_find = ["Pride and Prejudice", "Alice's Adventure in Wonderland"];
//! for book in &to_find {
//!     let reviewed = book_reviews_r.get_and(book, |reviews| {
//!         for review in reviews {
//!             println!("{}: {}", book, review);
//!         }
//!     });
//!     if reviewed.is_none() {

//!
//! Reads from multiple threads are possible by cloning the `ReadHandle`.

//!
//! If multiple writers are needed, the `WriteHandle` must be protected by a `Mutex`.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::thread;
//! use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
//! let (book_reviews_r, mut book_reviews_w) = evmap::new();
//!
//! // start some writers.
//! // since evmap does not support concurrent writes, we need

//! let w = Arc::new(Mutex::new(book_reviews_w));
//! let writers: Vec<_> = (0..4).map(|i| {
//!     let w = w.clone();
//!     thread::spawn(move || {
//!         let mut w = w.lock().unwrap();
//!         w.insert(i, true);
//!         w.refresh();
//!     })
//! }).collect();
//!
//! // eventually we should see all the writes
//! while book_reviews_r.len() < 4 { thread::yield_now(); };
//!
//! // all the threads should eventually finish writing
//! for w in writers.into_iter() {
//!     assert!(w.join().is_ok());
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Implementation
//!
//! Under the hood, the map is implemented using two regular `HashMap`s, an operational log,
//! epoch counting, and some pointer magic. There is a single pointer through which all readers
//! go. It points to a `HashMap`, which the readers access in order to read data. Every time a read
//! has accessed the pointer, they increment a local epoch counter, and they update it again when
//! they have finished the read (see #3 for more information). When a write occurs, the writer
//! updates the other `HashMap` (for which there are no readers), and also stores a copy of the
//! change in a log (hence the need for `Clone` on the keys and values). When
//! `WriteHandle::refresh` is called, the writer, atomically swaps the reader pointer to point to
//! the other map. It then waits for the epochs of all current readers to change, and then replays
//! the operational log to bring the stale map up to date.
//!
//! Since the implementation uses regular `HashMap`s under the hood, table resizing is fully
//! supported. It does, however, also mean that the memory usage of this implementation is
//! approximately twice of that of a regular `HashMap`, and more if writes rarely refresh after
//! writing.
